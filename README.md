# Project: A miniature relational database with order

## 


### Prerequisites

Dependencies: numpy, sys, time, itertools, operator, re and BTree implementation. The BTree implementation is taken from https://github.com/SimonCqk/BTree. 

### Running the test

This program takes input_path of tests.  Run this program using 
```
python3 main.py input_path

```
My own test file is called test.txt. Run using
```
python3 main.py test.txt

```

The program will print the running time for each single query and produce a text file of the result table (if the input query generates one). After all queres done, it will also produce a file containing all reuslting tables called 'nl1668_lz1883_AllOperations'.  This program assumes 'sales1.txt' and 'sales2.txt' to be in the same directory as test.txt, util.py and main.py. 

We tried to run our .rpz on crunchy5, but got an error. But we could run this .rpz from other seperate liunux machines, we have attached a screenshot of us running .rpz in a seperate unzip envirnment.
